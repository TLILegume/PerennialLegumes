# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-wrench" %}Datasets

Our program is committed to open-source science and data analysis. We benefit greatly from publicly available services, software, and data, thus we feel it is right to also open our datasets to the larger research community. We have been using Zenodo to publish our datasets so that we can have a DOI associated with all of the materials. Please cite our work appropriately if you use it in your research. Reach to our systems [admin](meyering@landinstitute.org) if you have any questions or concerns about the datasets.
